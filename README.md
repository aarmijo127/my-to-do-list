# my-to-do-list
A simple task list I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to input any task they want. It also allows users to check off and/or remove tasks. All changes get saved to the users local storage. As more tasks get added, a verticle scroll bar will appear, keeping the tasks in the white box.
